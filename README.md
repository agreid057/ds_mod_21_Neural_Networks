Homework for week 21 of the data analysis bootcamp 2024 - Neural Networks

## All Required deliverables are in the 'Submission' folder

The purpose of this analysis was to train and evaluate neural networks to predict the success of funding for an organization.

The data was based on historical funding activity from a nonprofit foundation to over 34,000 organizations. The foundation wants a model to help predict the success of an organization to be able to be more confident in the organizations it chooses to support. The accuracy goal for the models was 75%.

There were several features in this dataset that can help predict the success of these organizations like income amount, ask amount, use case, and classification.

To begin the stages of crating the neural networks I needed to work with the data to make sure it was clean and useable. I did some bucketing to make the values more balanced and initially dropped the NAME and EIN columns because they didnâ€™t add any predictive power. After the data was done being prepped, I began creating my neural networks and started to run the models. 

By using several models all with varying layers, different amounts of neurons, and different numbers of epochs I was not able to achieve the desired 75% accuracy.
